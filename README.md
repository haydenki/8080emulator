# 8080emulator

UPDATE: after a 2 months, I've finally started working on this again :D

The emulator works now! However, I have not implemented graphics, sound, or input yet. So when you run you'll only see the CPU flags/registers and opcodes. 

Also, I've only implemented the opcodes that Space invaders uses (yet). So you'll need to find a space invaders rom somewhere on the internet (it's easy to find).
